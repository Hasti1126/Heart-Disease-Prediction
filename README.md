# Heart Disease Prediction

This project aims to develop a heart disease prediction model using machine learning techniques. The model utilizes a dataset containing various features related to heart health and applies classification algorithms to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation contains information about patients and several health attributes that could be indicative of heart disease. The features include:

1. Age: The age of the patient (in years).
2. Sex: The gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male).
3. Chest Pain Type: The type of chest pain experienced by the patient (1 = typical angina, 2 = atypical angina, 3 = non-anginal pain, 4 = asymptomatic).
4. Resting Blood Pressure: The resting blood pressure of the patient (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital).
5. Cholesterol: The serum cholesterol level of the patient (in mg/dl).
6. Fasting Blood Sugar: The fasting blood sugar level of the patient (> 120 mg/dl = 1, 0 = otherwise).
7. Resting Electrocardiographic Results: Results of the resting electrocardiogram (0 = normal, 1 = having ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = left ventricular hypertrophy).
8. Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: The maximum heart rate achieved during exercise.
9. Exercise-Induced Angina: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
10. ST Depression Induced by Exercise: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
11. Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping, 2 = flat, 3 = downsloping).
12. HeartDisease : output class [1= heart disease, 0 = Normal]

The target variable is the presence of heart disease, where 1 indicates the presence and 0 indicates the absence of heart disease.

## Model

The heart disease prediction model is built using a machine learning algorithm, specifically a classification algorithm. The dataset is split into a training set and a testing set to train and evaluate the model's performance.

Several classification algorithms can be applied to this problem, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines (SVM). The choice of algorithm can vary depending on the performance and interpretability requirements.

The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the testing set to assess its accuracy in predicting heart disease. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be used to measure the model's performance.

## Usage

To use the heart disease prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed (Python, scikit-learn, etc.).
2. Download or access the heart disease dataset.
3. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing features, and splitting it into training and testing sets.
4. Train the heart disease prediction model using a suitable classification algorithm.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
6. Save the trained model for future predictions.
7. Load the saved model when needed and utilize it to predict heart disease based on new input data.

## Further Improvements

The heart disease prediction model can be further improved in several ways:

1. Feature Engineering: Exploring and deriving new features that may have a stronger correlation with heart disease can enhance the model's predictive power.
2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the parameters
